Object Contour Detection / Edge Detection CNN using Tensorflow 2 using U-Net architecture: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf

The convolutional neural network can be improved by training on training examples. This is done by running the following command in the command line: </br>
```python CNN.py --train```

The convolutional neural network can be used to make predictions of the edges by executing the following command: </br>
```python CNN.py --predict```
